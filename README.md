# Urban Traffic Safety Technology

## Overview

This project aims to analyze urban traffic accident data to understand the factors contributing to accident severity. By using machine learning models, we predict accident severity and identify key environmental features that impact the outcome of accidents. The analysis is performed using both regression and classification models, and the results are visualized for better insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), which includes accident data from February 2016 to March 2023, covering 49 states of the USA. The dataset contains approximately 7.7 million accident records with various features such as:

- **Temperature (F)**
- **Humidity (%)**
- **Visibility (miles)**
- **Wind Speed (mph)**
- **Precipitation (inches)**
- **Severity** (target variable)

## Installation
